## Inspiration

When we think of the places that bring us unique experiences, restaurants tend to be near the top of that list. But the restaurant business is one that is notoriously low-margin and capital intensive. Instead of wrangling spreadsheets and other forms of data, restaurant owners should be able to focus on creating the best possible experience for their customers—from farm to table—while having the best analytics to show them a true 360 view of their business.

This is especially true during the pandemic; as restaurants need capital to keep their doors open, we want to ensure that small business owners have a full picture of their finances at all times.

## What it does

Our product, the Plate Financial API, supports restaurants with the highest quality data that they can get pertaining to their business. The Plate Finance API is really a suite of APIs that return information pertaining to inventory and orders—and gets all of the granular details from the products that have the highest profit margins, predictive analytics around which hours might be tough for businesses if they do not have enough inventory.

## How we built it

We are using MongoDB as our database, Express.js for our server, React.js for our front-end, and Node.js for our backend—including our API design and our integrations with the Toast and Square POS.
